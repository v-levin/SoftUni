TECH MODULE
 - Technology Fundamentals: Programming Fundamentals
 
    The "Programming Fundamentals" course extends the beginner knowledge of writing programming code from the course "Programming Basics" and introduces basic programming techniques and tools for practical programming beyond the writing of simple programming constructs.
  
    The course covers work with source code repositories and team interaction tools such as Git and GitHub, getting to know the types of data in programming and their peculiarities, subtracting code pieces into methods with parameters and return methods, using a debugger to track code execution and find Error handling, processing of elements through arrays and lists, use of collections, work with matrices for table data processing, dictionaries and associative arrays for pairs processing and storage {key-value}, work with strings and word processing and basic knowledge of working with classes and objects using the API classes and define their own classes.
  
    Along with programming techniques, the course develops algorithmic thinking and builds solving skills by working on hundreds of practical exercises. All exercise and homework tasks are evaluated in real time with the automated SofUni online judging system. The course ends with a practical programming exam.
