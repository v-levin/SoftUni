- Technology Fundamentals: Software Technologies

    The "Software Technologies" course provides initial knowledge of the most used software technologies in practice and allows students to orientate which technologies they like to study them more thoroughly. Basic concepts from front-end and back-end development are studied. The course consists of four parts: HTML5 development (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + AJAX + REST), PHP Web Development (PHP + MySQL), C # Web Development (ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework + SQL Server) Java + Spring MVC + Hibernate + MySQL).
    
    The training methodology is extremely practical. The studied material is presented with little theory, with numerous examples and a great number of practical tasks with increasing difficulty and upgrading one after another, with detailed instructions. Practical work in class under the supervision of lecturers and assistants (or home for online students) is over 70%. The course only acquaints you with the technologies you are learning and gives you a very basic skills without getting into the depths. The goal is not to learn the covered technologies, but to get acquainted with them.
    
    In the first few topics, students are introduced to the HTML5 platform. Through many hands-on exercises, the basics of the HTML web content description language in combination with the CSS web content styling language and the JavaScript language that builds dynamic client web application executed in the web browser (front-end development) are explored. Basic JavaScript elements are studied - its syntax, range of variables, conditional constructs, cycles, arrays, objects, functions and their use, access to DOM elements. It continues with the practical use of AJAX technology to retrieve data from REST services and access BaaS Cloud Data Storage (Kinvey). To link everything that has been studied up to now, as a practical project, students build a simple blog system based on HTML5, AJAX, and REST.
    
    In the next few topics, students are introduced to PHP and MySQL. After installing and configuring a workspace for PHP (XAMPP or LAMP), they get to know the language, its syntax, conditional constructions, cycles, arrays, functions. Continuing with very brief introduction to HTTP protocol and processing of GET and POST queries with PHP. Here is a very brief introduction to relational databases and MySQL through examples and practical exercises. Learning to define tables and links between them, writing very simple SQL queries, and accessing MySQL from PHP - extracting, adding, changing, and deleting rows. To link everything learned in the last few topics, as a practical project, students build a simple blog system based on PHP and MySQL.
    
    After passing through these topics, students get acquainted with C # Web development. It starts with a practical understanding of MS SQL Server and Entity Framework technology to access data from C # applications. Following are the basics of ASP.NET MVC server web development technology - views, controls, models, forms, data access, user registration, and login. Following is the development of a practical project - a simple blog system based on ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework and SQL Server.
    
    In the last few topics, students are introduced to Java Web development. It starts with a short introduction to the Java language - syntax, variables, conditional constructs, cycles, arrays, lists, classes and objects. Next is the introduction to Hibernate ORM and access to a MySQL database from Java. Continued with Java Web Applications (Servlets / JSP) and Java MVC Web Development Technology. Following is the development of a practical project - a simple blog system based on Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL.


PROFESSIONAL MODULS
 - C# Fundamentals: C# Advanced
 
    The "C# Advanced" course examines the .NET platform, as well as working with the C# language above the startup. This includes coding skills, problem solving skills, familiarizing with standard work tools (.NET Framework), word processing tools, linear and tree collections, and working with files and directories. Particular attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as its basic tool - LINQ to process data streams. The course will also deal with asynchronous programming, and throughout the course of the course the students will be divided into teams that will have to make a practical project. The development environment to be used by the training team is Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 + JetBrains ReSharper, but each student is free to use preference tools.
    
- C# Fundamentals: C# OOP Basics

    The "Object Oriented Programming" course will teach you the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), how to work with classes and objects, how to use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP will be studied as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. We will pay attention to paradigms such as event-driven programming, functional programming (lambda functions, closures and LINQ), exception handling. We will look at cloning, comparing, and crawling objects. We will briefly review the most commonly used design patterns. Examples, homeworks and projects will be in C#, Java and PHP.
    
 - C# Fundamentals: C# OOP Advanced
 
    In the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course, you will learn about the principles and best practices for building quality software. You will learn about the concepts for writing quality code in OOP in C#. This includes using abstractions, refactoring, as well as writing unit tests, reflection, working with template data types, using events and techniques, and tools to improve the quality of the code. The course ends with the development and defense of a practical course project and a practical exam.
    
 - C# DB Fundamentals: Databases Basics - MS SQL Server
 
    Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern applications, making them an integral part of almost every application.
    
    The intensive basic course of databases will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course focuses on relational modeling, data modeling with ER charts (tables and relational links) and SQL language (data retrieval, selection, projection, joining, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Fundamental knowledge about ACID transactions and transaction processing and practical tips for adjusting productivity are provided.

    This course sets the basics of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts such as database transformation into an object-oriented model (ORM).

- C# DB Fundamentals: Databases Advanced - Entity Framework

    We will look in detail at working with a modern ORM technology: Entity Framework (EF), which is a standard for ORM in C # and .NET applications. EF allows mapping between a relational base and an object-oriented model using the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. We will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer on sophisticated systems using the "Repository" and "Unit of Work" templates.

    During the course a practical team project will be developed that includes the practical use of different DB servers (SQL Server, MySQL), data access platforms and technologies (ADO.NET, Entity Framework, etc.) and import and export to various formats for data (JSON, XML).
