ENTRY MODULE
- Programming Basics

    The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills required for all Technology specialties at SoftUni. This includes basic coding skills, work with development environment (IDE), use of variables and data, operators and expressions, console handling (reading input and output printing), using the Conditional constructions (if, if-else) and cycles (for, while, do-while).
  
TECH MODULE
 - Technology Fundamentals: Programming Fundamentals
 
    The "Programming Fundamentals" course extends the beginner knowledge of writing programming code from the course "Programming Basics" and introduces basic programming techniques and tools for practical programming beyond the writing of simple programming constructs.
    
    The course covers work with source code repositories and team interaction tools such as Git and GitHub, getting to know the types of data in programming and their peculiarities, subtracting code pieces into methods with parameters and return methods, using a debugger to track code execution and find Error handling, processing of elements through arrays and lists, use of collections, work with matrices for table data processing, dictionaries and associative arrays for pairs processing and storage {key-value}, work with strings and word processing and basic knowledge of working with classes and objects using the API classes and define own classes.
  
    Along with programming techniques, the course develops algorithmic thinking and builds solving skills by working on hundreds of practical exercises. All exercise and homework tasks are evaluated in real time with the automated SofUni online judging system. The course ends with a practical programming exam.
    
    
- Technology Fundamentals: Software Technologies

    The "Software Technologies" course provides initial knowledge of the most used software technologies in practice and allows students to orientate which technologies they like to study them more thoroughly. Basic concepts from front-end and back-end development are studied. The course consists of four parts: HTML5 development (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + AJAX + REST), PHP Web Development (PHP + MySQL), C # Web Development (ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework + SQL Server) Java + Spring MVC + Hibernate + MySQL).
    
    The training methodology is extremely practical. The studied material is presented with little theory, with numerous examples and a great number of practical tasks with increasing difficulty and upgrading one after another, with detailed instructions. Practical work in class under the supervision of lecturers and assistants (or home for online students) is over 70%. The course only acquaints you with the technologies you are learning and gives you a very basic skills without getting into the depths. The goal is not to learn the covered technologies, but to get acquainted with them.
    
    In the first few topics, students are introduced to the HTML5 platform. Through many hands-on exercises, the basics of the HTML web content description language in combination with the CSS web content styling language and the JavaScript language that builds dynamic client web application executed in the web browser (front-end development) are explored. Basic JavaScript elements are studied - its syntax, range of variables, conditional constructs, cycles, arrays, objects, functions and their use, access to DOM elements. It continues with the practical use of AJAX technology to retrieve data from REST services and access BaaS Cloud Data Storage (Kinvey). To link everything that has been studied up to now, as a practical project, students build a simple blog system based on HTML5, AJAX, and REST.
    
    In the next few topics, students are introduced to PHP and MySQL. After installing and configuring a workspace for PHP (XAMPP or LAMP), they get to know the language, its syntax, conditional constructions, cycles, arrays, functions. Continuing with very brief introduction to HTTP protocol and processing of GET and POST queries with PHP. Here is a very brief introduction to relational databases and MySQL through examples and practical exercises. Learning to define tables and links between them, writing very simple SQL queries, and accessing MySQL from PHP - extracting, adding, changing, and deleting rows. To link everything learned in the last few topics, as a practical project, students build a simple blog system based on PHP and MySQL.
    
    After passing through these topics, students get acquainted with C # Web development. It starts with a practical understanding of MS SQL Server and Entity Framework technology to access data from C # applications. Following are the basics of ASP.NET MVC server web development technology - views, controls, models, forms, data access, user registration, and login. Following is the development of a practical project - a simple blog system based on ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework and SQL Server.
    
    In the last few topics, students are introduced to Java Web development. It starts with a short introduction to the Java language - syntax, variables, conditional constructs, cycles, arrays, lists, classes and objects. Next is the introduction to Hibernate ORM and access to a MySQL database from Java. Continued with Java Web Applications (Servlets / JSP) and Java MVC Web Development Technology. Following is the development of a practical project - a simple blog system based on Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL.
